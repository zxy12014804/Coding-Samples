An excerpt of the Stata do-file I wrote for my undergraduate thesis "Government Response and Learning During A Pandemic". The script mainly covers data merging and cleaning, data visualization, and difference-in-differences (DID) and event study analyses.

A piece of script I wrote for an ongoing project that scrapes and stores information from the TVMVDB online database, which contains a comprehensive collection of over 1 million news clips (in video) that have appeared on nearly 200 public TV channels in China.
